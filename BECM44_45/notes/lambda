
Any interface which contains only one abstract method is called
as Functional interface.

Lambda Functions

It is an Anonymous function which is developed to provide
implimentation for abstract method present in functional interface

 
 InterfaceName ref_var	= (args list)-> 
		                  {
			               stmts..
			               stmts..
			               return;
		                  };
		                  
	-> lambda operator
	
* The class where lambda function is created should not implement the Functional Interface.
* Lambda functions can be passed as an argument to a method/constructor.
